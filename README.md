# AyendeInterview
Interview questions are always tough to design. On the one hand, you need to create something that will not be trivial to do, and on the other hand,   

you have a pretty much hard time limit to a reasonable solution. For example, while implementing a linked list is something that I would expect anyone  

to be able to do in an interview, implementing a binary tree (including the balancing), is probably not going to be feasible.  


Interview tasks (that candidate can do at home) are somewhat easier, because you don’t have the same time constraints, but at the same time,   

if you ask for something that takes a week to write, candidates will skip the question and the position entirely. Another issue here is that if you ask a candidate  

to send a binary tree as a interview task, they are going to google –> copy & paste –> send, and you learn absolutely nothing*.  

* Oh, sometimes you learn quite a lot, if a candidate cannot do that, they are pretty much disqualified themselves, but we could do that more easily with Fizz Buzz, after all.

So I came up with the following question, we have the following file (the full data set is 276 MB), that contains the entry / exit log to a parking lot.

The first value is the entry time, the second is the exit time and the third is the car id.
